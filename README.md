Module 4 Challenge

The goal of this assignment is to analyze district-wide standardized test results. To accomplish this, we use python and jupyter notebook to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


The Analysis  
- From the data presented, it shows that all of the top performing schools where charter schools, such as Cabrera High School, with their overall passing rate being approximately 95%. However, all the worst peforming schools where district schools, such as Figueroa High School, which had overall passing rates that ranged between 52%-53%. 
- Schools who had a lower budget (ex: <$585 per student) had a higher passing rate with the overall passing rate being approximately 95%, than schools who had a higher budget (ex: $645-675 per student) whose overall passing rate being approximately 80% or lower. This leads to the conculsion that schools who have a bigger budget do not always out-perform schools who have a smaller budget.
